    case 'basic':
      return preferences.basicDetails.yourName && preferences.basicDetails.partnerName && preferences.basicDetails.location;
    case 'venue':
      return preferences.venue.venueType; // Only venue type, not location
    case 'theme':
      return preferences.theme.selectedTheme;
    case 'catering':
      return preferences.catering.cuisine;
    case 'photography':
      return preferences.photography.style;
    default:

  }
};
