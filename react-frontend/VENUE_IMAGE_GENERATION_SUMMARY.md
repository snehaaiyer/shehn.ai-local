# Venue Image Generation Implementation

## üéØ **Overview**

Successfully implemented AI-powered image generation for all 16 venue preference cards using Cloudflare AI API. Each venue type now has a custom prompt and can display AI-generated images that match the venue's characteristics.

## ‚ú® **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Venue Data Structure**
- **Added Image Fields**: Each venue type now has `image` and `prompt` properties
- **Custom Prompts**: Tailored AI prompts for each venue type to generate relevant images
- **Fallback Images**: Default image paths for when AI generation is not available

### **2. AI Image Generation**
- **Cloudflare AI Integration**: Uses existing Cloudflare AI service for image generation
- **Batch Processing**: Generates images for all 16 venue types in sequence
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-second delays between API calls to avoid rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and network issues

### **3. Enhanced UI**
- **Image Display**: Venue cards now show images in aspect-video containers
- **Generate Button**: "Generate Venue Images" button in the venue tab header
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during image generation process
- **Error Fallbacks**: Placeholder images when generated images fail to load

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **Venue Data Structure**
```typescript
{
  id: 'heritage-palaces',
  name: 'Heritage Palaces',
  description: 'Royal and heritage venues with historical significance and grandeur',
  capacity: '100-800 guests',
  features: ['Historical Architecture', 'Royal Ambiance', 'Traditional Cuisine', 'Cultural Experience'],
  image: '/images/venues/heritage-palaces.jpg',
  prompt: 'A majestic heritage palace wedding venue with grand architecture, royal courtyards, ornate decorations, traditional Indian wedding setup, elegant arches, and historical grandeur'
}
```

### **State Management**
```typescript
const [venueImages, setVenueImages] = useState<{ [key: string]: string }>({});
const [isGeneratingVenueImages, setIsGeneratingVenueImages] = useState(false);
```

### **Image Generation Function**
```typescript
const handleGenerateVenueImages = async () => {
  setIsGeneratingVenueImages(true);
  
  try {
    const existingVenueImages = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('generatedVenueImages') || '{}');
    const newVenueImages = { ...existingVenueImages };
    
    for (const venue of venueTypes) {
      const requestData = {
        theme: venue.name,
        style: 'Venue',
        colors: 'Natural and Elegant',
        season: 'Wedding Season',
        venueType: venue.name,
        customDescription: venue.prompt,
        guestCount: 200,
        location: 'India',
        imageCount: 1
      };

      const response = await CloudflareAIService.generateWeddingThemeImages(requestData);
      
      if (response.success && response.images && response.images.length > 0) {
        newVenueImages[venue.id] = response.images[0];
        localStorage.setItem('generatedVenueImages', JSON.stringify(newVenueImages));
        setVenueImages(newVenueImages);
        
        // Rate limiting delay
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in venue image generation:', error);
  } finally {
    setIsGeneratingVenueImages(false);
  }
};
```
